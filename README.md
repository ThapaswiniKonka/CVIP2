This is a Random Password Generator that generates strong and secure passwords with a mix of Alphabets, Numbers, and Special characters.
This takes parameters that are defined by the user such as the length and types of characters which are included.
Here I have used the "random" module.
This generator creates a password by randomly selecting characters from the allowed character sets.
It's a useful tool for enhancing the security of accounts by generating unique and complex passwords.
